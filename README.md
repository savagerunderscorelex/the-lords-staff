# The Lord's Staff

The Lord's Staff is a short options based text game played in a terminal. This story "game" is coded in Python. This is my first ever coding project, and I hope anyone who plays can enjoy it :)

# My Coding Background

I am a new(ish) programmer, which is why this project took me as long as it did. I decided to learn programming around this time last year, since I graduated from middle school and wanted to do self-improvement by learning things like programming, improving my drawing, and getting back into writing again. I found my life boring at the time because I didn't do my hobbies all that much. So learning about new things, especially programming,  helped me enjoy my life a lot better.
Summer of 2024 is when I learned a lot of the basics that helped me code this project. A little bit of my experience comes from my programming class at school, however since the class was just an intro class, it was more of a review for me.

# Idea

The idea from this project actually came from a Khan Academy project @LeaferStudios made under the Python course. I was doing this course to learn more about Python (and it's extremely helpful, I recommend this course for newer programmers) and decided to look at the projects other people made. I found it so cool, that I wanted to make my own. Although I took inspiration from this project, I did all the code by myself. If you want to see the project yourself, here is the link: [Kingdom of Eloria](https://www.khanacademy.org/python-program/kingdom-of-eloria-magical-text-based-rpg-adventure-game/6250948041228288). This wasn't the original link for the game, as apparently the creator switched the game with another one of their projects to make the other project the top project on Khan Academy. However, I think this project was really good, even if the creator thought that their other project was way better. 

# Understanding Some Functions
Some of the parts of the game may not be very clear, so I've decided to write them here instead of in the program to reduce eye strain within the terminal. 

1. **Skills that players can use within the maze depend on their currently equipped weapon.** This means that the skills available to you when a wooden sword is equipped is different from the skills available when a bow is equipped. This is important to know because weapons cannot be switched when inside the maze.

# How to Run This Program

## Required Downloads:

Python (latest version)
<br>This Program (thelordsstaff.py)

## Instructions

On a desktop (PC or laptop), download Python (if you haven't already) and this program. You can download the program by clicking on the program name that shows its commits, pressing the 3 dots on the right side and clicking "Download."

Once you've downloaded the program, right click on it and open it in your operating system's terminal. It should work!! Later, I'll try to use other websites where users could execute the code online.
