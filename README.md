# The Lord's Staff

The Lord's Staff is a short options based text game played in a terminal. This story "game" is coded in Python. This is my first ever coding project, and I hope anyone who plays can enjoy it :)

Short Description:
The Lord’s Staff is a story game that could be played in your command line. You awake in a village, with no knowledge of your name, who you are, where you came from, or even why you’re here. The only things you have are a couple of coins in your pocket, a sack on your back, and the overwhelming feeling to find something. The Lord’s Staff. 
The Lord’s Staff is a powerful weapon, worth more than the pockets of the wealthiest person on the planet. You know you should look for it, but with any valuable object up for grabs, others would want it too. You have to enter the castle’s maze, and turn the correct way to get to the Staff without losing your life.

# My Coding Background

I am a new(ish) programmer, which is why this project took me as long as it did. I decided to learn programming around this time last year, since I graduated from middle school and wanted to do self-improvement by learning things like programming, improving my drawing, and getting back into writing again. I found my life boring at the time because I didn't do my hobbies all that much. So learning about new things, especially programming,  helped me enjoy my life a lot better.
Summer of 2024 is when I learned a lot of the basics that helped me code this project. A little bit of my experience comes from my programming class at school, however since the class was just an intro class, it was more of a review for me.

# Journey
With coding this project came many difficulties. Some of the notes include my logs as I was in Nigeria. It was difficult to code at some points since I didn't have internet connection, or the power would go out and I couldn't charge my laptop, and is part of the reason it took me 3 months to finish the project. 
Another difficulty I had was my limited understanding of coding. Stack Overflow was my best friend when creating this project. Even with the resources that I had, it still took a ridiculously large amount of effort and time (22+ hours) to finally complete this project. I had to learn about random, while loops, and how to keep certain characters within prints statements to be able to finish the Lord's Staff.

# Idea

The idea from this project actually came from a Khan Academy project @LeaferStudios made under the Python course. I was doing this course to learn more about Python (and it's extremely helpful, I recommend this course for newer programmers) and decided to look at the projects other people made. I found it so cool, that I wanted to make my own. Although I took inspiration from this project, I did all the code by myself. If you want to see the project yourself, here is the link: [Kingdom of Eloria](https://www.khanacademy.org/python-program/kingdom-of-eloria-magical-text-based-rpg-adventure-game/6250948041228288). This wasn't the original link for the game, as apparently the creator switched the game with another one of their projects to make the other project the top project on Khan Academy. However, I think this project was really good, even if the creator thought that their other project was way better. 

# Understanding Some Functions
Some of the parts of the game may not be very clear, so I've decided to write them here instead of in the program to reduce eye strain within the terminal. 

1. **Skills that players can use within the maze depend on their currently equipped weapon.** This means that the skills available to you when a wooden sword is equipped is different from the skills available when a bow is equipped. This is important to know because weapons cannot be switched when inside the maze. 
2. **If players choose the right path, you get skipped to the next level.** This means that if you choose the monster-free path the first time and pick a monster-ful path, you skip having to fight the first level monster and fight the harder monster.

# How to Run This Program

## On your device

### Required Downloads

The .exe file in the folder "dist"

### Instructions

On a desktop (PC or laptop), download the .exe file, and double click on it. It should run in your command line!!
## Khan Academy
I also copied the code onto Khan Academy's code editor, so there would be an easier way to play. Here's the link: [l3xis4u: The Lord's Staff](https://www.khanacademy.org/python-program/the-lords-staff/5555592524578816). I hope you enjoy :3
